    **Vegan Lentil Curry:**
    Ingredients:
    - 1 cup red lentils, washed and soaked for 30 minutes
    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 2 tomatoes, finely chopped
    - 2-3 garlic cloves, minced
    - 1-inch ginger, grated
    - 1 green chili, finely chopped (optional, adjust to taste)
    - 1 tsp cumin seeds
    - 1 tsp turmeric powder
    - 1 tsp ground coriander
    - 1 tsp garam masala
    - Salt to taste
    - Fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnish
    - Water for cooking
    - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
    
    Instructions:
    1. Heat oil in a pot over medium heat and add cumin seeds. When they sizzle, add chopped onion, garlic, ginger, and green chili. Saut√© until onions become translucent.
    2. Add tomatoes, turmeric powder, ground coriander, and salt. Cook until tomatoes turn soft and the oil starts to separate.
    3. Drain the soaked lentils and add them to the pot. Add enough water to cover the lentils and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let it simmer until the lentils are soft and cooked through (approximately 15-20 minutes).
